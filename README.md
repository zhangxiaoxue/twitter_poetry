# “I Remember” Poems about City Impression 

Online: <a href="http://poem.xxzhang.info/" target="_blank">http://poem.xxzhang.info/</a>

In my project, I would like to combine “I remember” poems with the city impression. In this way, it could help interactors to learn a city through others’ memories. We know memory always reflect the most impressive thing left in peoples’ heart. So compared to the normal introduction of a city, a memory about this city is much more interesting and meaningful. This kind of “I Remember” is like a city photo, providing a much more pleasure experience to learn this city.
